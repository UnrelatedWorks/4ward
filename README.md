# 4ward
A simple html script that redirects a link to another 3rd party site.

It is recommended to place all redirect in a new folder and from the root public_html directory. /4/ is short and easy to remember

Useful for analytics, if a service does not allow linking directly to specific sites or as a url shortener. 

Can be placed inside the root directory of a empty folder unrelated.works/4/weeklymeet/index.html or renamed in a non empty folder unrelated.works/4/weeklymeet.html
The first solution does not require the user to enter .html at the end, just the name of the folder.
